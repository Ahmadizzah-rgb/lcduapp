This is a tutorial on how to convert your website into an app. This works whether your app was built in wix, wordpress, or coded from scratch. The app can function exactly as your website functions.

The types of apps you can make with this app to website process are somewhat limited in that you can't use native functionality on the phone. That being the case, the best types of websites that work with this process are information-based sites.

This works with wix and wordpress sites. That means you can make your mobile app wordpress site dream come true, as well as your mobile app wix site.
