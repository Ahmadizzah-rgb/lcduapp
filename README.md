This is an Ionic project that can easily be configured to turn your website into an app.

If you haven't already, check out the [Jameson Saunders YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/JamesonSaunders) for web and mobile development tutorials.

If you need help to build and publish the app, I have made a full course on that.
